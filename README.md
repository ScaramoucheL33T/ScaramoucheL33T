👺 Scaramouche | Cynical Hacker, Phantom in the Matrix

Yo, inhabitants of the digital zoo! Welcome to my personal digital hell — Scaramouche's Abyss. Who am I? A pentester for whom ethics is just an annoying Skype beep. An OSINT specialist who'll find your first VK post and your dog's taxpayer ID. A reverse engineer who disassembles malware like a mechanical watch — just to watch it tick before it dies. I'm not a hacker — I'm a digital demigod of chaos. If you're looking for a compliance manual, get out of here faster than I can dox your browser history and your grandma's pancake recipe.

🛠️ My Arsenal (Like a Knife in the Back: Sharp and Unexpected)

Pentesting to the Max: From blind SQLi to zero-days that make even ISS cry. Metasploit? That's kindergarten stuff. I exploit like it's the 90s, but with a cloud IP. Heard of Log4J? I've found holes that made it look like a donut hole.

OSINT Necromancer: I resurrect data from the graves of social media. Your anonymous account? Not so anonymous anymore. Your geolocation? I know which coffee shop you go to. Tools? My own scripts that parse even your dreams.

Red Team is My Black Soul: Attacks that make firewalls burn with shame. Phishing that bypasses even your common sense. I can lurk in your network for months, and you'll only find out from a rickroll on all corporate monitors.

Reverse & Other Black Magic: IDA Pro is my bible. I dissect trojans, vaccines, and toaster firmware. Cryptography? I don't crack AES, I find the fool who implemented it wrong. Hint: password123 is not a password, it's an invitation.

Hardware Trash: From cloning access cards to hacking surveillance cameras. If a device has even one chip — it's already mine.

🤡 Pro-Jokes from the Master:

"Why is antivirus like paparazzi? It flashes before your eyes but never saves you from the real threat. Lol, I disable it first."

"Are hackers bad at relationships? We just always end up man-in-the-middle."

"My favorite return code? 0xDEADBEEF."

📞 Contact (If You Absolutely Must)

Looking for me? You suck at looking. But if you really must:

Email? Seriously? Do you even understand what I do?
